# TheResistance

is the name of my first attempt using C# and the Asp.net framework. It is the beginning of a personal blog.  You can download the files and open them in Visual Studio Community 2017. The project is a web project so the best way I've found to initiate the program is to build the Index.cshtml or the Create.cshtml file VS without Debug pressing CTRL+F5 and chooseing Chrome to show my design and sample the navigation through the CRUD functions. I decided not to host online since I currently have no authentication.  Thanks.
